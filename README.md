# MillerInc Library for C#
A library for programming any type of application in C# that is used in most, if not all of Miller Inc programs. 

## Due to previous commitments, development on this repo is slowed
A physics engine and some other game software is in the works, may be a while before each is able to have something added to this library, but I will as time continues.
